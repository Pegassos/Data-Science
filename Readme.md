# Data Science

## Introduction to Data Science

**Solo Learn's data science course with Sklearn**

## Linear Regression

Discovering Data Science/Machine Learning Problems & Linear Regression (_univariate_ / _multivariate_) algorithms to solve these problems with sklearn for supervised data.

The model was trained to predict boston median house values based on RM & LSTAT.

## Classification

Seond part is about Classification problems for _binary_ & _categorical_ data.

The model was trained to predict the species of Iris flowers based on petals length & width with an accuracy of 97% with KNeighbors.

## Clustering

Clustering is about _unsupervised learning_ (no ground truth to validate the model) where we use KMeans algorithm which puts the data into n*clusters categorized by the same distance (Euclidien...) to the_centroid*.
